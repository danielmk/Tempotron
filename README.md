# Tempotron

This [tempotron](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1643) implementation is a fork of [this original repo](https://github.com/dieuwkehupkes/Tempotron) by 
[Dieuwke Hupkes](https://dieuwkehupkes.nl/). I am using the tempotron in a research project. I made it work in Python3, fixed some numpy deprecation warnings and added a method
to quantify classification accuracy.
